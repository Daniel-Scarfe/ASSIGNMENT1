<p>My name is Daniel Scarfe, my student number is S3872217. You can email me using S3872217@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is Australian, born in country Western Australia in 1984. Culturally I am Australian with some European roots. I speak English with not much of an Australian accent. I still live in WA, as do my parents, siblings, and most of my extended family. I have a younger brother and an older sister who have three children each, two girls and one boy apiece. By way of education, I completed Certificate IV in IT in 2005. I have previously been a student at Murdoch University where I studied Environmental Science before switching to Statistics, finishing with 35 out of the 72 credits needed for a Bachelor of Science. Of possible interest, in my twenties I travelled to America with friends for a bachelorâ€™s party in Los Vegas, also visiting Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, and New York. This is probably how I developed my obsession with American politics and Late-Night comedians like Stephen Colbert John Oliver, Trevor Noah, and Samantha Bee.
