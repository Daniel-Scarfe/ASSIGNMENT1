  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
<BR><HR></center>
  <BR><BR>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The project is a smartphone app that can quickly bring up 3 facts on any given subject or topic that can then be used as a basis to communicate information or argue a point. There will also be a website version of the app for desktop better suited to online chats. The app will have customizable home screens with pre-set links of the topics the user thinks they will need at the ready which then opens to 3 pieces of information ready to use. The information can be facts about a subject, points to argue a position or talking points. The aim is to make information easily accessible and digestible to fight misinformation and improve communication by reducing the need to use memory recall or sifting through websites when arguing a point and remove the temptation of improvising facts or be left without words - which then harms the credibility of the user and can allow the misinformation to go unchallenged. Other uses could be to cram before a test, a job interview, or doctor’s appointment, any situation where you want a quick refresh of talking points minutes before a meeting or even a quick reference in-meeting. Information on infinite topics of interest can be downloaded from an ever-expanding database (eventually) or you can research and write your own 3 facts using the standard template with sections to write in sources. The 3 main things will be character limited so they are tweetable with the click of a button and to encourage brevity.  It’s structured to prevent information overload and stay on point.
</p>
<p>Think digestible Wikipedia articles, news articles, the case against the anti-vax movement, Qanon, climate change denial, for prison reform, increasing tax on the wealthy, renewable energy, federal ICAC, and think the audience is ordinary people - e.g. your Dad who’s always voted liberal - the topics are infinite. Communicable structured facts/arguments at your fingertips to get your case across effectively. Counterpoints to disprove a position. When arguing a subject the ethos should be: Be respectful -don’t condescend, listen, find common ground, try again. Slowly bring people around - family members and friends - after likely many attempts.
</p><BR>
  <h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>The motivation for this app is to combat misinformation by giving regular people quick access to 3 facts - with sources - on a topic to use in arguing a point, in real life, or online. So they won’t be speechless or rambling and the other person won’t be left having their incorrect information validated by not being challenged. Concerns about public misinformation —ranging from politics to science—are growing (Scheufele & Krause 2019). People are misinformed when they confidently hold wrong beliefs. Misinformation acts as an obstacle to educating the public with correct facts. Moreover, widespread misinformation can lead to collective preferences that are far different from those that would exist if people were correctly informed (Kuklinski et al. 2000). This project does have a viewpoint and in that it is biased to the truth and a tool against spin and manipulation specifically made for the post-truth world. It’s important to counter misinformation and make informed citizens - a necessity for a truly democratic society and something I’m passionate about. It’s interesting because I think the possibilities of the application are endless and it would be an ongoing project with an ever-expanding database.

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <h5>App</h5>
<p>The working title of the app is ‘3 Things’. The main feature of the app will be to show three facts or points on a topic listed on the screen, limited to 280 characters including the topic description. Something you can look at as a refresher before entering into a discussion or refer to during a discussion. Topics will be categorized and accessible through a search of your database using keywords or by navigating through the topics tree beginning with broad topics that get more specific or branch out to related areas. personalised home screens can be set up with buttons for topics you’ll think you’ll need for quick reference. So for example you’d open the app which would be pre-set to one of your customized topic list screen that would be displaying your list of topics that you require at that time. And you can click on each topic to open up a screen with the 3 facts listed for that topic. You could then use these facts in the discussion you’re having to convey your point or support your argument. The search function will be useful when needing information on the fly.
</p>
<h5>Links</h5>
<p>Another feature of the app will be the ability to copy the 3 facts to the clipboard to be pasted into any application you like - Twitter, text, email, etc. You can set links to your favourite apps so you could tweet the information with the click of a button for example. There will also be a button to reveal the sources or references for each of the three facts. A green light will be next to the fact to indicate when a source or reference is available. These sources can also be tweeted or copied to the clipboard. There will also be a button that can reveal 3 more facts on the same subject if they’re available. Another button will take you to a screen with a list of similar topics. So, ‘3 Facts’, ‘3 more facts’, ‘Similar Topics’, ‘Tweet’, ‘Copy to Clipboard’, ‘Search’ and ‘Home’ with takes you to the Home screen which gives you the search option or the option to go to your pre-set lists of facts or browse through topics as well as a button to add a new topic with 3 facts using the standard template, which can be saved to a list of similar topics in a personalised database (which you can store solely on your phone or the cloud) or be uploaded to the main public database where it will be added once verified by fact-checkers.
</p>
<h5>Website</h5>
<p>There will also be a website version of the app aimed at desktop PC use, which has access to the public database, or you can access your personalised database if you have stored it on the cloud by logging in (or another access method, which will be looked at after further research and development). The website will also give you the ability to copy to clipboard so information can be used in online chats that you don’t have access to on your phone or you can Tweet or email etc.
</p>
<h5>Database</h5>
<p>There will be a main public searchable database of topics with 3 facts that all users will have access to. All facts on the main database will have references filled out, all information will have been fact-checked and verified. Users will help grow the database. But the app is a standalone program that can be used solely on user created information (which was the original idea before thinking of a public shared database also). The user inputs the information - the app provides the format, structure, and functionality. The app can be used without any internet connection. The database has the potential to be run similar to Wikipedia via volunteers and funded by donations to cover any costs - ideally, fact-checkers would be paid.
</p>
<h5>Innovation</h5>
<p>The innovation I’d like to see is if AI could be used to turn Wikipedia articles and News articles in to ‘3 Things’ topics and automatically fill out the template producing a subject with 3 facts and the sources. And also associated subjects and additional facts. So the articles would be abbreviated and summarised using the ‘3 Things’ format. It would be possible for writers to adopt the format by included a ‘3 Things’ button to add subjects with 3 facts from their story to your personalised database - just like how many news articles have social media and sharing buttons - a ‘3 Things’ button could be added.

  <h4>Tools and Technologies </h4>
<p>	The hardware needed to create the project is a Microsoft Windows-based computer system to run the software that will be used to create the website and app and to test the Website version of the project. An Android smartphone will be needed to test the app. An internet connection will be needed for access to software, tutorials, and troubleshooting. The software needed to create the website is Atom and Github Desktop. Chrome and Firefox Browser will be used for testing website functionality and for accessing Github and additional software and websites. Github will be used to host the website and database. The database will be created using Microsoft Excel which will also be used to create mock-up designs for the app. The App development will be done using MIT App Inventor to produce a prototype and Android Studio will be used for the final version. Additional software may be needed as development progresses.

  <h4>Skills Required </h4>
<p>	The skills required will be proficiency in HTLM code to create the website and familiarity of Atom and Github tools. HTML tutorials can be found at www.scrimba.com and www.w3schools.com. Basic skills in Excel will be needed to create the database and mock-ups, and further database skills may be required after additional research and development. Skills with MIT App Inventor to produce the prototype app will be needed. Tutorials can be found at www.appinventor.mit.edu. To create the final app skills will be needed in Java and Kotlin code and use of Android Studio. Relevant tutorials can be found at https://developer.android.com/courses and www.youtube.com. This project will help me develop my IT skills, experience and knowledge making me more qualified for my ideal job.

  <h4>Outcome</h4>
  <p>If this project is successful the extreme position is that ignorance worldwide should decrease and conflict should reduce. People will realize their anger was being misdirected and People’s movements worldwide will expand based on popular working-class uprisings as they hold the powerful to account and demand the governments work for the people. There should be a marked decrease in conspiracy theory website traffic and right-wing media viewership. But just getting your conservative relative to come around on climate change or your friend to rethink their Antivaxx stance a little quicker than they normally would have, would be a huge success. The problem of misinformation will be solved with plain verifiable information; lies exposed with truth; a hesitant vague answer with a confident succinct one. The impact of having accessible and structured facts and arguments just a click away will be a huge asset for anyone wanting to combat misinformation - world peace is the logical endpoint.
  </p>
  <p>The potential drawbacks are that it could be used for nefarious purposes and itself used to push misinformation, but with proper safeguards and oversight and openness, these concerns could be mitigated. Possible comparisons to current note-taking apps could make it dismissed prematurely. Getting people to use it could be difficult - that’s why it must stay simple at its core - just 3 things. The greatest obstacle would be getting it excepted as a new standard in journalism and reporting - having it alongside the current share buttons at the end of articles. Also, database upkeep and fact-checking to keep the information verified will be hugely time-consuming.
