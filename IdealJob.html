<p>The position is for a Systems Administrator to work on their Network Services team, providing administration and technical support of server infrastructure and project management for upgrades as well as providing back up support. This appeals to me because it involves computer networks in a government environment. Administering and developing corporate systems, servers, databases, and data storage interests me. As well as ensuring the integrity and availability of data and email systems. The opportunity to plan and develop server, storage, backup, disaster recovery, and network infrastructure solutions would be an exciting and rewarding experience.
	<p>Skills will be needed in the organization, planning, problem-solving, communication, and customer service. As well as conceptual and analytical skills. Knowledge of Windows Server,  workstation operating systems, and SQL Server databases will be required. As well as knowledge of MS Exchange, Office and networking and server trends and standards. Experience in administering Windows servers, SQL databases, and email systems. As well as experience in network management, PC support, and software rollouts using automated tools. Qualifications required are a tertiary qualification in Information Systems or a related discipline and a class ‘C’ WA driver’s License.
	   <p>I currently have a Certificate IV in IT which may be at the lower end of the required tertiary qualification required but still technical qualify. I do have the needed driver’s license. I have the required skills which I pickup up from my previous work experience and university study. I have a basic form of some of the knowledge and experience required from my 3 years working at a computer store where I built and serviced computers and networks and provided technical support of operating systems, email, databases, backup, and security software. I have experience with personal, small business, government, and education IT systems. I’m lacking comprehensive knowledge and adequate experience in multiple areas.
	<p>I’ll be able to gain more of the knowledge I require and build on my existing skills by completing the Bachelor of IT I plan to apply for once I complete the two introductory courses I am currently enrolled in. I will then use that qualification to get an entry-level job in Network Administration where I’ll pick up any missing knowledge and gain the required experience. It will likely take several years and possibly several positions to gain all relevant knowledge and experience to move up to a Systems Administrator position.
