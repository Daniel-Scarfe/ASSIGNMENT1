  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

  <h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
<p>I have an interest in IT because of all the vast amounts of information it makes available to you, the ability it has to connect you with people and ideas far beyond your physical location and it’s practical applications for solving problems, making life easier and more fulfilling. It allows your knowledge to be expanded far beyond your book collection. Ideas and viewpoints outside your family and group of friends are available in real-time and able to be interacted with. It’s constantly finding ways of completing everyday tasks more efficiently and so giving people more time to exploring their passions and interests and helps them do that too. The speed of development is exciting to watch with new gadgets and applications being released constantly. IT is interesting to me because it opens up the world and can be used to solve problems big and small.
</p>
  <h4>When did your interest in IT start?	Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.
  </h4>
<p>My interest in IT started as soon as I was introduced to computers in primary school. The event that sparked my interest was when Dad brought home our first computer - a 2nd hand DOS-based 386 - it didn’t take long before I pulled it apart and put it back together and was learning how to use the command prompt. After High School, my first full-time job was at a computer store which was pretty much my dream job - building and fixing computers all day. Here I did a traineeship and completed Certificate III and IV in IT. Since I left I’ve still been regularly fixing computers for friends and family.
</p>
  <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT for practical reasons - they had a Bachelor of IT degree available, you could study it externally and there was an easy pathway in through Open Universities Australia. I’d got the urge to study something and my life circumstances allowed for it so I narrowed down a Bachelors of IT from the available options. I more or less had the thought, did some quick research to see what my available options were, decided, and enrolled on the same day. RMIT matched all my criteria.
</p>
  <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
<p>During my studies, I expect to learn all the practical applications of IT as they exist in the world today and to gain a broad understanding of the systems, processes, and infrastructure underpinning them all. I expect to learn how to develop and install the appropriate IT solutions for a wide range of situations. By the end of my studies, I expect to be able to provide maintenance and support of network administration, IT systems, business applications, and websites. Depending on what peaks my attention throughout the course I expect to have more in-depth knowledge in certain areas, such as data management,  web and mobile computing, software systems development, security and cloud computing, or artificial intelligence among others.  I expect to learn the skills of an IT professional and be made ready to enter the IT industry.
