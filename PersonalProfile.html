<p>The Myers-Briggs test at www.16personalities.com found I have a ‘Mediator (INFP-T)’ Personality Type. I scored 79% Introverted, 77% Intuitive, 58% Feeling, 64% Prospecting and 85% Turbulent. I interpreted these results as meaning I’m an idealist, always looking for the good in people and events and searching for ways to make them better. I come across as calm and reserved. I’m guided by principals and am led by my purity of intent and not reward or punishment. I often feel misunderstood which can lead to isolation. These results may affect my behaviour in a team by meaning I am less likely to speak up and put forward ideas and it may take me longer to communicate effectively and feel comfortable working with others. So when forming a team I should take these results into account by fighting the urge to stay quiet and not be fearful to contribute my thoughts.

<p>The Learning Style quiz at www.learningstylequiz.com found I was a Visual-ISTP learner - Introverted Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving. With a Learning Style Distribution of 40.7% Visual, 40.7% Kinesthetic, and 18.5% Auditory. I interpreted these results as meaning I want to know how everything works. I work well independently and can work through problems or material quite efficiently but tend to work in uneven patterns or spurts. My optimal learning situation is when the material is presented repeatedly with examples and the learning process is progressive but not rushed. I struggle with hypothetical or theoretical examples and need real-world examples for information to sink in. I’m a visual learner who prefers images over words. These results may affect my behaviour in a team by taking longer to digest information if I don’t find relevant examples and could drop behind the knowledge level of fellow group members hindering my ability to contribute. When forming a team I should take these results into account by being aware of taking too long to process information and find new examples or explanations if I get bogged down. I may have to allow extra time for study to stay on top of the work.

<BR><BR></center>
<p>  	The Big Five Personality test at www.bigfive-test.com found I scored High in Neuroticism at 95, Low in Extraversion at 61, High in Openness to Experience at 93, High in Agreeableness at 114, and Low in Conscientiousness at 67. I interpreted these results as meaning I have a high tendency to experience negative feelings, be tense, nervous be sensitive to what others think of me. I panic under pressure. I tend to feel overwhelmed by people and feel the need to have time to myself. I tend not to talk much and let others control the activities of a group. I have an imaginative, creative cognitive style and use fantasy as a way of creating a richer, more interesting world. I appreciate good cooperation, social harmony, and value getting along with others. I have low impulse control, self-discipline, and are content to get by with a minimal amount of work. These results may affect my behaviour in a team by being likely to not put in enough effort and likely not to contribute my fair share. So when forming a team I should take these results into account by contributing sufficiently to group work and be wary of not pulling my weight, I could use some contribution targets and have a goal of speaking up and putting forward 3 ideas at each meeting and have X amount of interactions per week.
</p>
<p>For a critique on the validity of the results, I would say that although I thought some results accurately defined me, others did not and there were contradictions between tests and even within tests but overall I would conclude they are useful at providing a rough snapshot of some broad aspects of my personality and some traits I hold. I do agree that I’m highly introverted and have high anxiety. But I don’t think I’m guided by my principals over logic as per the Myer’s Brigg test. I think if you don’t assume these tests are 100% accurate which I don’t believe they claim to be and are just used as a guide or of a way to get you thinking or some self-reflection then they possibly could hold some value.
